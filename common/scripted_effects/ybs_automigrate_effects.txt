# We are going to look for a new home for the unemployed pop based on its traits.
# Where possible we will try to match them to a planet that they would be most
# producive one. If that's not possible, then to a random planet that has jobs
# and housing available.
#
# We are going to search in this order:
# - Research
# - Unity
# - Trade
# - Fortess
# - Mining
# - Energy
# - Farming
# - Rural
# - 80% or better habitablity
# - 60% or better habitablity
# - 40% or better habitablity
# - any free jobs
