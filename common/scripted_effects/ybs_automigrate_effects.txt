# We are going to look for a new home for the unemployed pop based on its traits.

# producive one. If that's not possible, then to a random planet that has jobs
# and housing available.
#
# We are going to search in this order:
# - We'll do 3 passes of the specalised types.
# - First at 80%, then 60%, then any%.
# - Research
# - Unity
# - Trade
# - Fortess
# - Mining
# - Energy
# - Farming
# - Rural
# - Then we'll check based on habitablity only.
# - 80% or better habitablity
# - 60% or better habitablity
# - 40% or better habitablity
# - any free jobs
